# Simple Pong Game

## Overview
This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the classic game "Pong." The game was created by Franoll Fantu with major inspiration by @TokyoEdTech with added features such as Enter To Play and Restart or Quit, as a fun project to practice programming and game development skills.

## Features
- Two-player Pong game.
- Player A can control their paddle using the "W" and "S" keys.
- Player B can control their paddle using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.
- The game keeps track of the score for both players.
- A win condition: The first player to reach a score of 7 wins the game.
- Sound effects for wall hits, paddle hits, and scoring.
- A start screen prompting the player to press "Enter" to begin the game.
- The option to restart the game by pressing "R" and quit by pressing "Q" after a player wins.

## How to Play
1. Run the game.
2. The start screen will appear, displaying "Press Enter to Play."
3. Press "Enter" to start the game.
4. Control your paddle using the designated keys (Player A: "W" and "S," Player B: "Up" and "Down").
5. Score points by getting the ball past your opponent's paddle.
6. The game ends when one player reaches a score of 7.
7. A win screen will display the winning player's name and instructions to restart ("R") or quit ("Q").

- `pygame` for sound effects
